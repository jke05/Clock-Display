21. It starts off at 00:00 because we didn't set a time
23. 3600 times
I could make it easier by calling the setTime method
24. private NumberDisplay digit;
   
    NumberDisplay digit = new NumberDisplay();
25. private Rectangle window

    Rectangle window = new Rectangle();
    
    window.length = 40;
    window width = 40;
26. The second constructor creates a clock that lets you choose the
hour and minute of your choice. It does this with (int hour, int minute)
27. The setTime(hour,minute) alreayd takes care of the updateDisplay method
28. p1.print("document", true)
    p1.print("text", false)
29.
